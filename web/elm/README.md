# README

This is a (currently really) basic tool for Agile / SCRUM teams to
assign issues in the sprint to each team member according to their
estimated capacity.

It's written in Elm, and I love it!!!

## How to

```
npm install
gulp
```

You may now open your browser at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

## TODO

- Input of issues
- Design / UX
  - Progress bar for remaining capacity
  - Fix team members column
  - Allow selection of developer/reviewer through a dropdown menu (instead of only drag'n'drop)
- Export of assignments
- Setup of team members capacity
- Give access to issue details
- Priorities as set in JIRA should be applied / visible
